## Impact of 5G Launch on Revenue

- From the overall KPIs:
  Total revenue is ₹31.9 billion.
  Revenue before 5G was ₹16.0 billion, and after 5G it declined slightly to ₹15.9 billion, showing a -0.50% drop.

- City-wise data also reflects mixed performance: some cities like Lucknow and Gurgaon saw gains, while others like Delhi and Chennai saw declines.

- Overall, the 5G launch has not yet increased revenue significantly, but it has stabilized user interest in high-data plans.
