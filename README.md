## Impact of 5G Launch on Revenue

- From the overall KPIs:
  Total revenue is ₹31.9 billion.
  Revenue before 5G was ₹16.0 billion, and after 5G it declined slightly to ₹15.9 billion, showing a -0.50% drop.

- City-wise data also reflects mixed performance: some cities like Lucknow and Gurgaon saw gains, while others like Delhi and Chennai saw declines.

- Overall, the 5G launch has not yet increased revenue significantly, but it has stabilized user interest in high-data plans.

Which KPI is underperforming after the 5G launch?


## KPI – Key Performance Indicators 

- ARPU - Average Revenue Per User
- TAU - Total Active Users
- TUsU - Total unsubscribed Users
- MA - Monthly Average
- The launch of 5G has resulted in a slight decrease in total revenue. 
- Pre-5G revenue stood at ₹16.0bn, dropping to ₹15.9bn post-launch—a decrease of 0.50%. While some cities maintained stable performance, others showed a marginal revenue decline. 
- Notably, major city revenue figures like Mumbai and Delhi stayed robust, but overall monthly trends indicate no significant uplift

## After the 5G launch, which plans are performing well in terms of revenue? Which plans are not performing well?

- Well-performing Plans: The "Smart Recharge Pack (2GB/Day for 3 months, p1)" excelled, generating ₹4.2bn total revenue—₹2.4bn after 5G, compared to ₹1.8bn before. Other plans like p2 and p3 also show sustained or improved revenue month-over-month.

- Underperforming Plans: Plans p10 to p13 have relatively low monthly revenue, with some cities reporting bottom-tier billings.

## Is there any plan affected largely by the 5G launch? Should we continue or discontinue that plan?

- The "Smart Recharge Pack (p1)" saw the largest positive impact, with post-5G revenue outpacing pre-5G collections. 

- Plans with persistently low revenue output- such as those at the bottom of the ranking (e.g., p13)- should be reviewed for discontinuation or major overhaul, focusing instead on the combos driving user engagement.

## Is there any plan that is discontinued after the 5G launch? What is the reason for it?

- The data suggests select lower-performing plans (likely p12, p13) have either been discontinued or deprioritized, as their post-5G monthly revenues are negligible or missing. 

- Reasons for discontinuation include insufficient user adoption, high churn, and lack of differentiation compared to popular combo packs.
